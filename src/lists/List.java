/***
 * A LinearList is a linear ADT which inserts elements in O(n), deletes them in O(n)
 * and access them in O(n). Elements can only be added to the front or the back. Note
 * that this interface does not require that the implementation is a LinkedList, even
 * though that would be what makes most sense. It does not even specify whether the LinearList,
 * if linked, will have single or double links per node.
 * 
 * It is a requirement that the type T is Comparable, or else we will not be able to 
 * implement methods such as contains() and delete(). The interface itself extends the Iterable
 * interface, which means that we can use foreach() statements to easily access its elements.
