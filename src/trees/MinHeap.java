/**
 * MinHeaps are complete binary search trees whose node contents are always smaller than
 * the contents of their children nodes. MinHeaps inherit neither the Tree interface nor
 * the BinarySearchTree interface. This is because they are much simpler data structures
 * and it doesn't make sense for us to provide definitions for operations such as particular
 * tree traversals, or retrieving the maximum element from the tree. We thus make heaps
 * "atomic" tree structures in the inheritance sense.
